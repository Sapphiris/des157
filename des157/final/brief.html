            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Paküman is a game where two players take turns rolling dice to determine how much damage they do to the
                other player's Paküman, ultimately trying to get them to 0 HP.

            <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/">Pokemon Showdown</a> is a website that allows Pokemon fans to battle one another through a simulator. The battles would function like how they would be in the regular Pokemon games. Two players can choose the Pokemon that they want to send out first, then players take turns choosing moves to knock out their opponent's Pokemon. Their interface is a bit technical, as it also includes chat lobbies for players to discuss. I want to replicate the interactions during the battles, like choosing a Pokemon from a list and choosing a move. Everything on the website works well and runs smoothly, which I am hoping to achieve as well.

            <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://pvpoke.com/battle/">PvPoke</a> is another Pokemon battle simulator, but this website's intention is to calculate the outcome of two battling Pokemon with specific stats. I would say that this website's user interface is friendlier, and I like how we are allowed to choose what exact stats and moves that each Pokemon has. After clicking "Battle", we are given in-depth stats of how the battle went, and it's very statistical. I want to see if I can use any elements of this website in my own project. I'm thinking of taking inspiration from its user interface. I know that this website is more of a battle calculator, but I think that it's pretty similar to my project.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My project is very similar to both of the websites mentioned above. The theme is practically the same, and I want my project's battle sequence to be similar. Things that are different about these websites are that the first website had lobbies and communities for players to chat with, while the second website is more of a simulator calculator. My project will use neither of these aspects. My battle simulator will also be much simpler, possibly geared more towards younger children, as they may be unable to grasp the idea of "stats" within the realm of Pokemon. Err... I mean Paküman!

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                I want the overall look and feel of my project to be very user-friendly. This means that it may look a bit childish, but I also want to maintain the look of a retro video game at the same time. I also want my elements to be visually-pleasing, and not cram too much information in one place. If anything, I would want to use more graphics instead of words to display information. I want the colors to match the same theme (blue, black, and white), and I'm also trying to alter everything related to the Pokemon brand to make sure I'm not copyrighting anything, haha.

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                For my project's interactions, as it is a game, I want it to be button-based. I want the users to be able to control what buttons they want to press to simulate their battles. This may include the specific Paküman to send out and what moves to use against their opponent. The only time-based behavior that I'm thinking of including is part of the transitions of the HP bar changing, both in color and in width. I would want to also add more audio inputs for each button and action that the user takes. I might also add audio for each Paküman that I may include as well.

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I want my audience to experience a sense of enjoyment or fulfillment as they play my game. I would like there to be a variety of options to choose from so that the audience would not feel bored too easily. This would hopefully add a level of engagement to my project. The longer that I can get the user to stay on my page, the better. I want to increase the user experience as much as possible, by styling my page in a way where every element in the game is interactable. This may include adding hover effects or changing the colors or borders of some elements.
