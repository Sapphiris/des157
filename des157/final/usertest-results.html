            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>
                Upon entering the webpage, I could see that Maxwell was reading the overlay of tasks before proceeding.
                He then entered the names of the characters as tasked, then confirmed those names. After that, He
                proceeded to play the game, rolling the dice and having both characters deal damage to each other. I
                could see that he took some time to pause to admire the changing art. He said that the text might be
                difficult to read for some people. He liked how the overlay at the beginning told the user what to do or
                what to expect. He suggested having the action buttons in the same position with one another to make it
                easier for the user to access. Ivy also pretty much reacted the same way as Maxwell.

                Based on the feedback, I think I'll try to place the action buttons at the same positions as one another
                to prevent the user from needing to move their mouse up and down too much. I'll also try to increase the
                visibility or size of the text to make it easier to read.
