            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>

            <p>
                Upon reading the article about "Best Practices for Form Design", there were many things that I learned
                or found interesting. Many of the tips given were about what we can do as designers to limit the
                information given to the user. This includes making a one-column layout to make it easier for users to
                process information or including only relevant information in the content. Other tips include breaking
                things down into digestible steps for the user to process or asking less-complex questions first. I
                thought that these tips were really useful, and made me think about how I can integrate these into my
                own work. It made me put myself into the perspective of the user and see how they would process
                information. This would help me in the future so that I wouldn't overwhelm the audience.

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals, Overlays, and Dialog Windows</h2>
            <time datetime="2021-01-26">January 26th, 2021</time>
            <p>
                Modals, overlays, and dialog windows are user interface elements that have evolved into these annoying
                pop-up windows that users encounter daily while browsing the web. The purpose of these windows is to
                grab the user's attention to fulfill a task. The first instinct of many users is to find the "X" button
                to close it out. Best practices of creating a good modular window include giving the user some breathing
                room. This means to not surprise them, make accessibility easy, and not confuse them. I learned to keep
                these windows simplified and straightforward. As developers, we would not want our users to be
                frustrated and annoyed with these features.
